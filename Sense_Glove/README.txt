# Summary

Sense Glove is an exoskeleton glove designed to force the hand closed or open based on the users input. The glove is a rough prototype and mechanical layout for future better designed exo gloves.  My wish is that the community will take this open sourced design and add all the necessary things to make this exo hand dream possible. This is a rough working base design that functions.    




# Print Settings

Rafts: Yes
Supports: Yes
Resolution: best
Infill: solid or close to it

Notes: 
You will have to scale the models down, right now I scaled it down by .7  and it fit pretty good I have thick fingers so you will need to print one of the "pointer mid" model a couple times to get a real good fit.  I also cut away the strap on the pointer base knuckle my fingers were again to big for the strap.  You will have to rotate all the models but there is a flat point on each .stl file and that was the way I had printed it myself successfully.  

# How I Designed This

## Why and how I made this.

I originally wanted to make the sense glove for virtual reality where you could grab an object in 3d space and actually feel it.  For instance picking up a gun and squeezing the trigger and feeling the actual handle of the gun and the sensation of pulling a trigger.  To achieve something like this I started researching exo skeleton gloves.  I came across the German robotics company Festo and discovered this https://www.festo.com/group/en/cms/10233.htm  So from the pics and videos I was able to figure out the overall mechanics and create my own version of the exo glove. The capabilities of the exo glove and all the things it could potentially do, especially for the E-nable community is something I would like to see blossom beyond me.
